Taste and Texture Perceptions: While product innovation is ongoing, some consumers still perceive plant-based alternatives as inferior in taste and texture compared to traditional meat and dairy products.
Limited Availability: Despite growing demand, plant-based products may not be as widely available in all regions of Spain. Limited distribution can restrict consumer access and slow market growth.
